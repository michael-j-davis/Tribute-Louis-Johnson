    			<ul>
      				<li>Louis Johnson was an American bass guitarist.</li>
      				<li>Johnson was best known for his group The Brothers Johnson.</li>
      				<li>He played sessions on several hit albums of the 1970s and 1980s including the "best selling album of all time" <em>Thriller</em></li>
      				<li>His signature sound came from the Music Man StingRay bass guitar, which Leo Fender made for him, and from his slapping technique.</li>
      				<li>Due to his distinctive style, Johnson was nicknamed "Thunder-Thumbs"</li>
      				<li>His slap bass playing arrived soon after Larry Graham brought it into the mainstream, and both are considered the "grandfathers" of slap-bass playing.</li>
      				<li>He is ranked number 38 on Bass Player magazine's list of "The 100 Greatest Bass Players of All Time".</li>
      				<li>Without any plucking at all, Johnson sets a complicated funky bass line using a combination of counterpoint slapping with right hand using right thumb, counterpoint with left hand middle finger as a mute tec., called a <em>slap choke</em>, thus
        creating a percussive sound like drums, adding to the bass notes.</li>
      				<li>His style incorporated more funk plucks in combination with his thumping, which along with the Music Man StingRay sound gives a very funky, unique sound.</li>
      				<li>Louis Johnson died on May 21, 2015 at the age of 60.</li>
    			</ul>
